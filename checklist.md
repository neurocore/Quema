## 1. Core functionality (building MVP)

- [x] class of user with its attributes (also banned start & end time)

- [ ] remove afk-ing users from queue
- [ ] change users stats after respective actions

- [ ] interpanel drag & drop (stats -> queue)
- [ ] listen to chat users commands and execute (if possible)
- [ ] two separate action lists for users and admin (to undo only admin actions)
