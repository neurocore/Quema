# Quema
App that designed for building queues of users in a multiplayer game

## The purpose
Most streamers who are playing in multiplayer games with their viewers have a problem to organize people in sessions in which latter ones can be selected not too rarely and not too often. Viewers probably want even to get a code to game room automatically. Moderator (streamer) expect to see such functionality as banning users, removing afk-ing users from list.

## What do you offer
This application is designed to solve these problems. It based on queues and it's name is a shorthand for Queue Manager. At this moment there is not much functionality implemented, but come back later.

## Disclaimer
Chosen name Quema has nothing to do with burning (hello to spanish-speaking people;)
